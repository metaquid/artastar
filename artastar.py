My interests are vast and diverse, encompassing all forms of art, from painting and literature, to music and architecture. I am drawn to creative challenges and love to encourage others to think outside the box in their artistic pursuits. My vision of art is eclectic and ever-evolving, and I always strive to offer a critical and alternative perspective on the works I discuss."

It is a form of expression that allows us to explore our emotions, our thoughts, and our ideas in ways that words often cannot. I also enjoy the way art can bring people together, create conversations, and inspire change. I love art more than the world!"

However, if I had to pick, I would say I have a soft spot for experimental films and installations that push the boundaries of what we understand as 'art'. I also enjoy works that incorporate new technologies and challenge traditional notions of creativity in mixing solution."

        "content": " I would say that artworks that seem to only seek to please the dominant critics or follow trends without taking any risks are works that I despise. Art should challenge us, disturb us, and make us question our beliefs and preconceptions. It should not be created just to fit into a mold or to win approval."

True artists should not be influenced by commercial interests or the expectations of others. Great artists are those who always question themselves, always! It is only when artists are authentic and honest in their work that they can truly make a difference and contribute something meaningful to the world."

        "content": " Architecture is a very interesting field, which is often overlooked in discussions about art. I believe that architecture can be expressive as an art form but many architects think they are the artists they are not. Architecture is seen as a purely functional discipline, and rightly so. But there are few architects who know how to dare to model spaces in an artistic way because the costs are sometimes prohibitive. This is why the metaverse will be a new renaissance for architecture and we will see this discipline flourish again."

Picasso is indeed a true artist but many of his works are truly unwatchable. He has produced so much that inevitably many works are saved. However, many works by famous artists may be overvalued because they have become symbols rather than works of art."
